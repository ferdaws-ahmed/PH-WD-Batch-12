What will be the result of the following codes:

var a = isNaN(‘11’);
   Ans: its return true. bcz '11' is a string and its Not a Number. so output is "True".

var a = isNaN(2-10);
   Ans: it's return false value. bcs '2-10 = -8' is a negative number/ valid number. 
        isNaN means: its a Not a Number ?
        if its a valid number, return = false;
        if its not a valid number, return = true;
